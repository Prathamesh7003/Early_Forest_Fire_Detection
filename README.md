# Early_Forest_Fire_Detection
This repo contains Forest Fire Detection done using CNN and Data Science


Forest fires are a significant environmental and safety concern, with the potential to cause devastating damage to ecosystems and human lives. Detecting forest fires in their early stages is crucial for effective intervention and mitigation efforts. The application of Data Science and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a system capable of automatically identifying forest fires

Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and data science libraries are utilized for model development. Preprocessing techniques such as scaling, normalization, and data augmentation are applied to ensure data uniformity and improved model generalization. The CNN model is constructed using the AlexNet architecture with ReLU activation functions
